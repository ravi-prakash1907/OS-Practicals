## Operating System : Practicals
This repository holds the practiclas of Operating System.<br />
All the practicles are either in ```C``` or ```C++``` language.
  
## Practical List  
1. WRITE  A  PROGRAM  (using  fork() and/or exec()  commands)  where  parent  and  child  execute:   
> a)same program, same code.   
> b)same program, different code.  
> c)before terminating, the parent waits for the child to finish its task.  
2. WRITE  A  PROGRAM  to  report  behaviour  of  Linux  kernel  including  kernel  version,  CPU  type and model. (CPU information)  
3. WRITE  A  PROGRAM  to  report  behaviour  of  Linux  kernel  including  information  on configured memory, amount of free and used memory. (memory information)    
4. WRITE  A  PROGRAM  to  print  file  details  including  owner  access  permissions,  file  access  time, where file name is given as argument.   
5. WRITE A PROGRAM to copy files using system calls.   
6. Write program to implement FCFS scheduling algorithm.   
7. Write program to implement Round Robin scheduling algorithm.  
8. Write program to implement SJF scheduling algorithm.   
9. Write program to implement non-preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.  
10. Write program to implement preemptive priority based scheduling algorithm.  
11. Write program to implement SRJF scheduling algorithm.  
12. Write program to calculate sum of n numbers using thread library.  
13. Write a program to implement first-fit, best-fit and worst-fit allocation strategies.
